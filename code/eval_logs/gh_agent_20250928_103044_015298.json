          "content": "The error message `No matching signature for operator '=' for argument types: 'STRING', 'INT64'` typically occurs when you attempt to compare or assign a string type with an integer type. Here are some solutions to fix this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Data Type Consistency**: Make sure the fields you are comparing or assigning are of the same data type. For example, if one field is `STRING`, the other should also be converted to `STRING`.\n\n   If you are using a `CASE` statement or a comparison in an SQL query, ensure that number literals are enclosed in quotes so they are treated as strings. For instance:\n   ```sql\n   CASE payment_type\n   WHEN '1' THEN 'Credit card'\n   WHEN '2' THEN 'Cash'\n   ...\n   END\n   ```\n\n2. **Casting Fields**: If one field is an integer (like `INT64`) and the other is a string, you can convert the integer to a string using a cast:\n   ```sql\n   CAST(your_integer_field AS STRING) = your_string_field\n   ```\n   Conversely, if your string needs to be an integer:\n   ```sql\n   CAST(your_string_field AS INT64) = your_integer_field\n   ```\n\n3. **Example from Data Engineering Course**: In the context of the Data Engineering course, if you have a `LocationID` in one table as `STRING` and in another as `INT64`, you should unify their types using casting:\n   ```sql\n   {{ dbt.safe_cast(\"PULocationID\", api.Column.translate_type(\"integer\")) }} as pickup_locationid\n   ```\n\nBy addressing type mismatches through either converting the field types or adjusting the literals in your SQL, you should be able to resolve the error.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to these specific sources:\n- [dbt: macro errors with get_payment_type_description](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-4/039_89733da275_dbt-macro-errors-with-get_payment_type_description.md)\n- [Join Error on LocationID: \"Unable to find common supertype for templated argument\"](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-4/077_faddbcb675_join-error-on-locationid-unable-to-find-common-sup.md)",
