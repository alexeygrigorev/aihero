              "content": "```\nImportError: DLL load failed while importing cimpl: The specified module could not be found\n```\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Verify Python Version:**\n   \n   Ensure you are using a compatible version of Python with the Avro library. Check the Python version and compatibility requirements specified by the Avro library documentation.\n\n2. **Load Required DLL:**\n   \n   You may need to load `librdkafka-5d2e2910.dll` in your code before importing Avro. Add the following:\n   \n   ```python\n   from ctypes import CDLL\n\n   CDLL(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\\\anaconda3\\\\envs\\\\dtcde\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\confluent_kafka.libs\\\\librdkafka-5d2e2910.dll\")\n   ```\n   \n   Note that this error may occur depending on the OS and Python version installed.\n\n3. **Alternative Solution:**\n\n   If you encounter `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing cimpl`, you can try the following solution in PowerShell:\n\n   ```bash\n   $env:CONDA_DLL_SEARCH_MODIFICATION_ENABLE=1\n   ```\n\n   This sets the DLL manually in the Conda environment.\n\n### Source:\n\n[Confluent-Kafka Python Issue #1186](https://githubhot.com/repo/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/issues/1186?page=2)",
