By default, Pandas will cast these columns as `float`, leading to inconsistent data types between the Parquet files in GCS and the schema defined in BigQuery. You might encounter the following error:\n\n```bash\nerror: Error while reading table: trips_data_all.external_fhv_tripdata, error message: Parquet column 'DOlocationID' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE.\n```\n\n### Solution:\nFix the data type issue in the data pipeline:\n\n1. Before injecting data into GCS, use `astype` and `Int64` (which is different from `int64` and accepts both missing values and integers) to cast the columns.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    df[\"PUlocationID\"] = df.PUlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n    df[\"DOlocationID\"] = df.DOlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n    ```\n\n2.

If the file extension is `csv.gz` instead of `csv`, it won't store correctly.\n\nTo handle this:\n\n1. Replace `csv_name = \"output.csv\"` with the file name extracted from the URL. For example, for the yellow taxi data, use:\n   \n   ```python\n   url = \"https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\"\n   csv_name = url.split(\"/\")[-1]\n   ```\n\n2. When you use `csv_name` with `pandas.read_csv`, it will work correctly because `pandas.read_csv` can directly read files with the `csv.gz` extension.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nurl = \"https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\"\ncsv_name = url.split(\"/\")[-1]\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(csv_name)\n```",

          "content": "When handling missing values in the `DOlocationID` and `PUlocationID` columns while using Pandas to inject data into Google Cloud Storage (GCS), it's recommended to ensure correct data types to avoid errors during the loading process to BigQuery.\n\nHere is the recommended approach:\n\n1. Use the `astype` method to convert the columns to the `Int64` data type. This type is specifically designed to support missing values (represented as `NaN` in Pandas), which allows for both integers and missing values:\n\n   ```python\n   df[\"PUlocationID\"] = df.PUlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n   df[\"DOlocationID\"] = df.DOlocationID.astype(\"Int64\")\n   ```\n\n2. It's essential to perform this data type conversion prior to loading the data into GCS. This ensures that the columns do not end up being cast to `float`, which could cause type mismatches with the schema defined in BigQuery.\n\nThis approach effectively handles missing values and maintains data integrity across your pipeline.\n\nFor additional details, see the reference: [GCP BQ: How to handle type error from BigQuery and Parquet data?](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-3/023_66d3c42dd4_gcp-bq-how-to-handle-type-error-from-bigquery-and.md)",
