If you no longer need it, you can delete it:\n  \n    ```bash\n    rm -rf <anacondainstaller_fpath>\n    ```\n\n  - **(~3GB)** Anaconda itself takes up a lot of space. You can\u2019t delete it entirely if you need Python, but you can clean it up significantly:\n    \n    ```bash\n    conda clean --all -y\n    ```\n\n- **Clean up your Kestra files:** Use a purge flow. You can find a generic example here:\n  \n  [https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge)\n  \n  I wanted to perform the cleanup immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the month, so I adjusted the `endDate` to `\"{{ now() }}\"` and removed the trigger block. You can also choose whether to remove FAILED state executions.\n\n- **Clean up your PostgreSQL database:** You can manually delete tables in pgAdmin, or set up a workflow in Kestra for it. I found it easy to do manually.",

Here's how you can remove it:\n\n   ```bash\n   rm -rf <anacondainstaller_fpath>  # Replace with the actual path to the Anaconda installer.\n   ```\n\n   If you still need Anaconda but want to free up some space, you can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda clean --all -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Clean Up Kestra Files**: To manage your Kestra files, you can use a purge flow. For immediate cleanup, you may adjust the `endDate` to reflect the present time, and decide if you'd like to remove entries in a \"FAILED\" state. You can find guidance on this in the Kestra documentation [here](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/purge).\n\n4. **Manage PostgreSQL Database**: Clean up your PostgreSQL database by manually deleting unnecessary tables through pgAdmin or by setting up a workflow in Kestra.\n\nBy implementing these steps, you should be able to manage your storage more effectively and prevent running out of space further down the line. \n\nFor further details, you can refer to the source material: [Running out of storage when using Kestra with Postgres on GCP VM](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-2/007_00e8093b90_running-out-of-storage-when-using-kestra-with-post.md).",
