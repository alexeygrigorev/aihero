Familiarize yourself with documentation as a crucial skill for problem-solving.\n- Use shortcuts like `[ctrl+f]` to search within documents and browsers.\n- Analyze the error message for descriptions, instructions, and possible solutions.\n- Restart your application, server, or computer as needed.\n  \n**Search for Solutions:**\n\n- Use search engines like Google, ChatGPT, or Bing AI to research the issue. It is rare to encounter a unique problem.\n- Form your search queries using: `<technology> <problem statement>`. E.g., `pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.`\n- Consult the technology\u2019s official documentation for guidance.\n\n**Uninstallation and Reinstallation:**\n\n- Uninstall and then reinstall the application if needed, including a system restart.\n- Note that reinstalling without prior uninstallation might not resolve the issue.\n\n**Seeking Help:**\n\n- Post questions on platforms like StackOverflow. Ensure your question adheres to guidelines: [how-to-ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).\n- Consider asking experts or colleagues in the future.\n\n**Community Resources:**\n\n- Check Slack channels for pinned messages and use its search function.\n- Refer to this FAQ using search `[ctrl+f]` or utilize the `@ZoomcampQABot` for assistance.\n\n**When Asking for Help:**\n\n- Provide detailed information: coding environment, OS, commands, videos followed, etc.\n- Share errors received, with specifics, including line numbers and actions taken.\n- Avoid screenshots; paste code or errors directly. Use ``` for code formatting.\n- Maintain thread consistency; respond in the same thread instead of creating multiple ones.\n\n**Re-evaluation:**\n\n- If the issue recurs, create a new post detailing changes in the environment.\n- Communicate additional troubleshooting steps in the same thread.\n- Occasionally take a break to gain a fresh perspective on the problem.\n\n**Documentation Contribution:**\n\n- If your problem solution is not listed, consider adding it to the FAQ to assist others.",
